The analyses characterize spatial tumor\u2013immune\u2013stromal organization, infer cell\u2013cell communication, and derive spatially informed gene expression signatures that predict response to immune checkpoint blockade across cancer types. Project Overview This repository serves as the computational companion to a spatial transcriptomics study of RM-HNSCC treated with immune checkpoint blockade. It implements the analytical workflow underlying the manuscript, organizing the full sequence of computational steps required to reproduce the reported results given appropriate data access. The framework supports: preprocessing, integration, and quality control of spatial transcriptomics data; annotation of malignant and non-malignant compartments using orthogonal approaches; modeling of spatial neighborhoods and intercellular communication; extraction of spatial tumor\u2013microenvironment features; and translation of spatial features into gene expression signatures validated in external bulk RNA-seq cohorts. All analyses are implemented as modular, configurable scripts designed for transparency, reproducibility, and extensibility. Protected patient-level data are not distributed in this repository; however, all code required to reproduce the analyses is provided. Reproducibility Modular pipeline implemented in R and Python Dependency management via Pixi Configuration-driven execution to support multiple cohorts and analyses Set Up Prerequisites Pixi is required to run this project.
